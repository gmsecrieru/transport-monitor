# transport-monitor
This is an application suite simulating distributed microservices that track and persist GPS emission from vehicles. In a real world scenario this would probably be splitted in different projects, but for simplicity's sake this is a single project with all solutions.

All configuration is currently based on a development environment (which is defined in `src/config/dev.js`) and assumes every `transport-monitor` service (and their dependencies) are running in containers in a single `docker-machine` (IP `192.168.99.100`). Make sure to set this up in for your needs before running/building the application suite.

Each application execution is described below, but before running any of the following instructions, you must install dependencies or build the Docker image:

### Installing dependencies
```
$ cd transport-monitor
$ npm install
```

### Building the Docker image
```
$ cd transport-monitor
$ docker build -t transport-monitor .
```

The most liquely approach for running this suite is to start the services in the following order:

- 1. `Seeder` - Generate fake data
- 2. `Gateway` - Receive GPS emissions and persist to a Message Queue system
- 3. `Consumer` - Consume messages from queue, evaluates/validates and persist following business logic
- 4. `Emitter` - Send fake emissions for each car generated by `Seeder` (each 20 seconds)

## Seeder
Generates 1000 fake vehicles and stores in a MongoDB `vehicles` collection.

### Usage:

### Local execution
```
$ npm run seeder

> transport-monitor@0.1.0 seeder /Users/gmsecrieru/Projects/gmsecrieru/transport-monitor
> TASK_NAME=seeder babel-node src/index.js

[seeder] Done
$
```

### Docker image
```
$ docker run -it -e TASK_NAME=seeder transport-monitor
[seeder] Done
$
```

## Emitter
Emitter reads data persisted from `Seeder` and sends a fake GPS emission to `Gateway`.

### Usage:

### Local execution
```
$ npm run emitter
...
$
```

### Docker image
```
$ docker run -it -e TASK_NAME=emitter transport-monitor
```

## Gateway
Handles GPS emissions in an HTTP endpoint, which checks authorization and persists emission to a Message Queue for later processing.

### Usage:

### Local execution
```
$ npm run gateway
...
$
```

### Docker image
```
$ docker run -it -e TASK_NAME=gateway transport-monitor
```

## Consumer
Consumes GPS emissions from a Message Queue, validate and persist (or discard) information

### Usage:

### Local execution
```
$ npm run consumer
...
$
```

### Docker image
```
$ docker run -it -e TASK_NAME=consumer transport-monitor
```
